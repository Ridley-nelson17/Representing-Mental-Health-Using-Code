# Representing-Mental-Health-Using-Code
As someone who's experienced trauma, this repository is consisted of multiple branches with different programs that I've made to track and visually represent how I've been doing to hopefully help me improve my current state if needed.

## Daily Assessment 
This branch, well-this tool is pretty self explanatory. It's a Website that I have set to open on my phone every day and it consists of 3 assessments. The PHQ-9 (a modified version) The DMI, and The DML. All of these evaluate anxiety and depression levels. I do plan on adding an overall motivation assessment-but that will wait for next month due to the way my data is coming in.
