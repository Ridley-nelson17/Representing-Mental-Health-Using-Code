# Representing-Mental-Health-Using-Code
As someone who's experienced trauma, this repository is consisted of multiple branches with different programs that I've made to track and visually represent how I've been doing to hopefully help me improve my current state if needed.

> I've decided to close this repository because there are way better options very similar to what I was trying to make like "How We Feel" on the iOS app store.
